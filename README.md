# Maintenance Cost Reduction through Predictive Techniques




## Problem Definition
A company has a fleet of devices transmitting daily sensor readings. They would like to create a predictive maintenance solution to proactively identify when maintenance should be performed. This approach promises cost savings over routine or time based preventive maintenance, because tasks are performed only when warranted.
## Goal
To build a predictive model using machine learning to predict the probability of a device failure by minimizing the false positives and false negatives. The column to Predict is called failure with binary value 0 for non-failure and 1 for failure.
