## Maintenance Cost Reduction through Predictive Techniques
Problem Definition

A company has a fleet of devices transmitting daily sensor readings. They would like to create a predictive maintenance solution to proactively identify when maintenance should be performed. This approach promises cost savings over routine or time based preventive maintenance, because tasks are performed only when warranted.
Goal is to build a predictive model using machine learning to predict the probability of a device failure by minimizing the false positives and false negatives. The column to Predict is called failure with binary value 0 for non-failure and 1 for failure.
